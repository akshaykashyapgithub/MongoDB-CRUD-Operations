# MongoDB ETL Operations with Docker & Jupyter

## Overview
This project demonstrates an Extract, Transform, and Load (ETL) workflow using MongoDB and Jupyter Notebook, all containerized with Docker for easy setup and reproducibility.

- Load JSON data into MongoDB
- Perform CRUD operations using PyMongo inside Jupyter Notebook
- Use Docker Compose to orchestrate MongoDB and Jupyter services

## Features
  1. Load large JSON dataset (restaurants.json) into MongoDB
  2. Demonstrate Insert, Read, Update, Delete (CRUD) operations
  3. Use PyMongo for MongoDB interaction inside Jupyter
  4. Fully containerized environment for portability and ease of use

## Technologies Used
  1. MongoDB (NoSQL database)
